1) Factory restore 
Factory restore by holding in the "MODE" button in 30 seconds. It's important that the AP does not get an IP by DHCP at this time. 
Then you will drop out to a shell in ROMMON where you must delete two files by:
ap> delete flash://private-multiple-fs flash://env_vars
ap> boot

After it's booted, you can log in via console with default password "Cisco". 

2) Transfer the autonomous image
Put the autonomous firmware (ap3g1-k9w7-tar.152-4.JB6) on a TFTP server. 

Now activate the debug-mode so we can configure the AP, by issuing
# enable
# debug capwap console cli
# debug capwap client no-reload 

And give it a static IP, then it only takes half the time...
# conf t
# interface BVI 1
# ip address x.x.x.x n.n.n.n
# exit
# ip default-gateway g.g.g.g

Now, transfer the image with TFTP
# archive download-sw /overwrite tftp://y.y.y.y/ap3g1-k9w7-tar.152-4.JB6.tar 

When it's done, check that it's going to boot the k9w7-image by:
# more flash://env_vars

If all is good, restart by:
# reload
